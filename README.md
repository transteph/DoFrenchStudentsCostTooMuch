# Introduction
After two full days of Advanced R lessons by Joel Gombin [(@joelgombin)](https://github.com/joelgombin) we were thrown head-first into a Datathon -  1.5 days of aquiring, cleaning, analyzing (and a bit of hair-pulling) with 'open' data. Led by Timothée Gidoin [@Gidoin](https://github.com/Gidoin), it was a lot of trial and error. As a group, we agreed that the data available was inconsistent, lacked interoperability, and was overall unreliable. We decided that leaving the research question unanswered would be a responsible move considering the lack of quality data.
