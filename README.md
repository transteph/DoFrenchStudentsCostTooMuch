## A Little Walkthrough
After two full days of Advanced R lessons by Joel Gombin [(@joelgombin)](https://github.com/joelgombin) we were thrown head-first into a Datathon -  1.5 days of aquiring, cleaning, analyzing (and a bit of hair-pulling) with 'open' data. Led by Timothée Gidoin [@Gidoin](https://github.com/Gidoin), it was a lot of trial and error. And error...and error. 

First thing's first: loading all of the required libraries.
